### Description ###

PGORM is a server that accepts HTTP requests from the browser and returns response depending on access type (see below).
The database is configured with list of tables that will be mapped to JavaScript classes.
For each table, JavaScript module is automatically generated, be used through the construction
*import {[Table],[TableList]} from '/orm/[Schema]/[Table].js';*

### Access types ###

*   **ORM** - working with PostgreSQL table rows as JavaScript objects (object-relational mapping)',

*   **SQL** - execution of SQL queries and commands, the result is returned in JSON format with auto-casting',

*   **[GET] file** - receiving files (.html, .js, etc.), including a JavaScript module for connecting to a database, executing SQL queries, working with tables'


### Important qualities ###

*   **Modules and class overriding** - For each table, two modules are created: an editable one with empty inherited classes and an autogenerated one with superclasses, which is recreated when the table structure changes
*   **Auto type conversion</b>** - implemented automatic conversion of SQL and JavaScript data types, including arrays
*   **Table row and array** - Two classes are created for each table: single table row (TableRow) and array of rows (TableRowArray extends Array)
*   **Row array automethods** - In class of table rows, load by index and sort methods are automatically created
*   **Naming** -  Class name for table and field names for the columns are formed automatically, but can specify them explicitly
*   **Autocorrect** - When performing DDL operations on table (alter table, create index, etc.), trigger fires, which updates the JavaScript module. 
*   **Simplicity and sufficiency** -  Server sends the modules created by it via HTTP, installation consists in copying the executable file and creation of the service, no third party libraries required (libpq already installed with postgres)
